    "- *Support for spaCy v3.*\n",
    "- *If using spaCy v3, the `SpaczzRuler` optional arguments no longer need to be prepended with `\"spaczz_\"`. This will still work in most cases offering some backwards compatibility. However, optional arguments prepended with `\"spaczz_\"` will not work with spaCy v3's new `spacy.load` and `nlp.add_pipe` config-driven APIs. It is therefore recommended that users move away from using the prepended versions if using spaCy v3. It should be noted however that the prepended arguments are still necessary if using spaczz with spaCy v2.*\n",
    "- *`Matcher.pipe` methods are now deprecated in accordance with spaCy v3.*\n",
    "- *`spaczz_span` custom attribute is deprecated in favor of `spaczz_ent`. They both have the same functionality but the `spaczz_ent` name makes more sense.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*v0.4.2 Release Notes:*\n",
    "- *Fixed a bug where `TokenMatcher` callbacks did nothing.*\n",
    "- *Fixed a bug where `spaczz_token_defaults` in the `SpaczzRuler` did nothing.*\n",
    "- *Fixed a bug where defaults would not be added to their respective matchers when loading from bytes/disk in the `SpaczzRuler`.*\n",
    "- *Fixed some inconsistencies in the `SpaczzRuler` which will be particularly noticeable with ent_ids. See the \"Known Issues\" section below for more details.*\n",
    "- *Small tweaks to spaczz custom attributes.*\n",
    "- *Available fuzzy matching functions have changed in RapidFuzz and have changed in spaczz accordingly.*\n",
    "- *Preparing for spaCy v3 updates.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/gandersen101/spaczz/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for previous release notes. This will eventually be moved to the [Read the Docs](https://spaczz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page."

    "The main reason for spaczz's slower speed is that the *c* in it's name is not capitalized like it is in spa*C*y.\n",
    "Spaczz is written in pure Python and it's matchers do not currently utilize spaCy language vocabularies, which means following it's logic should be easy to those familiar with Python. However this means spaczz components will run slower and likely consume more memory than their spaCy counterparts, especially as more patterns are added and documents get longer. It is therefore recommended to use spaCy components like the EntityRuler for entities with little uncertainty, like consistent spelling errors. Use spaczz components when there are not viable spaCy alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am actively working on performance optimizations to spaczz but it is a gradual process. Algorithmic and optimization suggestions are welcome. I am working on learning C but currently C-based work is outside of my skill set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FuzzyMatcher`, and even more so, the `SimilarityMatcher` are the slowest spaczz components (although allowing for enough \"fuzzy\" matches in the `RegexMatcher` can get really slow as well). The primary methods for speeding these components up are by decreasing the `flex` parameter towards `0`, or if `flex > 0`, increasing the `min_r1` parameter towards the value of `min_r2` and/or lowering the `thresh` parameter towards `min_r2`. Be aware that all of these \"speed-ups\" come at the opportunity cost of potentially improved matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the `SimilarityMatcher` description, utilizing a GPU will also help speed up it's matching process.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will likely try to develop some automated and/or heuristic-based API options (while retaining all the current options) in the future to simplify this \"tuning\" process."

    "This one is particularly annoying for me because I built myself into this hole trying to support too much too fast. That being said I have addressed much of this as of spaczz 0.4.2 and will continue to improve these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spaczz, like spaCy, has undefined behavior for multiple labels (or label/ent_id combos) sharing the same pattern. For example, if you add the pattern `\"Ireland\"` as both `\"GPE\"` and `\"NAME\"` the resulting label is unpredictable. For the most part this isn't an issue but spaczz also has to deal with the additional wrinkle of fuzzy matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we are looking for the string `\"Ireland\"` and have the patterns `[\"Ireland\", \"Iceland\"]`. Even with a required match ratio of `85` these will both match at `100` and `86` respectively. When just dealing with fuzzy matches this isn't an issue as we can sort by descending match ratio. However what if the `\"Iceland\"` pattern was a regex pattern and it returned a tuple of fuzzy regex counts? Or what if the `\"Iceland\"` pattern was a token pattern and the `TokenMatcher` does not even currently provide match details?!\n",
    "\n",
    "The above problem is twofold. First and foremost, I need to develop a way or ways to compare apples to oranges - fuzzy ratios and fuzzy regex counts. Then I need to figure out how to include match details from the `TokenMatcher` which supports both fuzzy and \"fuzzy\" regex matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a short-term solution I am having the entity ruler first go through sorted fuzzy matches, then sorted regex matches, and lastly token matches. Token matches will only be sorted by length of match, not quality, so they may provide inconsistent results. Try to be mindful of your token patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is additional logic in place to filter overlapping matches preserving earlier matches over later ones. This order of priority (fuzzy, regex, token) may not be ideal for everyone but adding a way to change the order (say regex patterns first) would a temporary solution to a temporary problem.\n",
